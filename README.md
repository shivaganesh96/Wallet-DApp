This will be where we describe the problems at hand with the way many
financial institutions operate. Also describe how cryptocurrencies like
Ethereum provides transparency so consumers can be fully informed(ledger concept).
Through cryptocurrency systems such as proof-of-work transactions can be validated
on a decentralized without third parties....

Explain how our DApp differentiates itself from other cryptos by being built on
a reliable network, and how our smart contracts can operate on mobile and 
why this matters. Improved usability -> increased adoption of cryptocurrency in
the mainstream. 

Explain how our main focus is not on solving the scalability problem. Although
it would be an interesting approach, it seems infeasable considering no other
cryptocurrency has truely solved the cryptocurrency scalability problem yet.
Building on Ethereum has added benefits in that their team is likely to have 
scalable DApps by the time all other crypto's are scalable in transactions.
Therefore building on their platform is the most reasonable approach to the scaling
problem. Assuming this project is maintained longer than project criteria say,
it is possible that the underlying core cryptocurrency consensus algorithm can
be altered to be more suitable for independent network scalability. Considering
current talents of those in team-31, we all have front-end or Application development
experience. These talents are much better suited for DApp Development which
can be implemented entirely in front-end languages.

Why I think Ethereum can create scalable DApps on their platform: plasma

Goals: Release an official DApp on the Ethereum Blockchain that will improve
mobile interfacing through smart contracts. This is to solve tha problem of usability
of cryptocurrency. Considering almost no one except programmers and cryptocurrency 
enthusiats/investors have a clue how blockchain technology works, let alone 
how smart contracts. These contracts are useful because they create automated, 
programmable transactions that are immutable since they exist on the blockchain.


DApp Build: successful, despite the following messages in javascript console(using Google Chrome) 
	MetaMask - injected web3
inpage.js:85 MetaMask: web3 will be deprecated in the near future in favor of the ethereumProvider

	The Mist release notice is nothing to worry about, but not sure why DEvTools
could not parse the source map. Besides that the Ethereum DApp wlakthrough was
about as straight-forward as I has assumed.
